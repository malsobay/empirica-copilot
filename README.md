# Empirica Copilot

![alt text](image.png)

A starter template + skill pack for creating and testing [Empirica](https://empirica.ly/) experiments with AI assistance.

This is a very early test and a work in progress. The goal is for the community to collectively create a set of skills that are capable and robust across a wide range of experimental domains and design complexity. 

## What this repo is

- An empty Empirica project structure you can use as a starting point.
- A set of Copilot Skills (under `.github/skills/`) to help with:
  - experiment specification
  - experiment implementation
  - data schema validation
  - autonomous E2E-style testing

## Current status of the skills

- **Spec + implementation skills:** these have been tested in reproducing a couple of experiments from published papers, but still need a bit of handholding. 
- **Autonomous E2E testing + verification skills:** promising, and can work with strong guidance, but **not yet ready for generic adoption** across arbitrary experiments.

## Repository layout

- `client/` – Empirica client app scaffold
- `server/` – Empirica server app scaffold
- `.github/skills/` – Copilot Skill definitions and supporting scripts

## Assumptions and safety

- This repo assumes you already have:
  - Empirica installed and runnable from your shell (`empirica`)
  - a CLI coding agent installed (Copilot CLI, Claude Code, etc.)
- Be careful with agent permissions and command execution scope.
- You are solely responsible for reviewing, monitoring, and approving agent actions in your environment.

## Quick start

1. Start your CLI coding agent in this repository.
2. Ask the agent to start building a new Empirica experiment using the skills in `.github/skills/`, e.g. "Using the spec and implementation skills, I want you to help me create a new experiment". The agent should begin by interviewing you about the experiment to determine the specifications, and then proceeding to an initial implementation, from which you can iterate by giving feedback. 
3. Run `empirica` at various points in the process to test the implementation and give more detailed feedback to the agent. 

## Using this repo without GitHub Copilot (e.g., Claude Code)

The skill files are plain text instructions plus helper scripts. Even if your coding agent does not support Copilot Skills natively, you can still use this repo by:

1. Opening the relevant `SKILL.md` file in `.github/skills/<skill-name>/`.
2. Copying the workflow/instructions into your agent prompt.
3. Running the referenced scripts/commands directly from the terminal.

In short: `.github/skills/` is Copilot-native packaging, but the underlying guidance and scripts are tool-agnostic.
